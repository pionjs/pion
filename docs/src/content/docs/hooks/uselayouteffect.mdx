title: useLayoutEffect

import ApiDoc from '../../../components/ApiDoc.astro';

The function signature is the same as `useEffect`, but the callback is being called synchronously after rendering. Therefore, updates scheduled inside `useLayoutEffect` will be flushed synchronously before the browser has a chance to paint.

Most of the time, it is preferable to use `useEffect` to avoid blocking visual updates.
